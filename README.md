#### Elements of this:
- You have 3 funding rounds to reach your target; Series A, Series B, Series C 
- If you raise more than your target, the extra funds will be transferred to Aave lending pool to generate yield on the extra funds 
- These funds will be kept on Aave for a fixed period of time, then gifted and distributed back to those who donated to the fundraiser 

##### Currently working on:
- DeFi integration with Aave 
- a countdown feature that automatically ends a funding round, without having to manually call the closeFundingRound function (currently using block.timestamp)
